				<p>
					LNB Federal Corporation, by affiliation through its wholly owned subsidiary <strong>Bitfastt Inc.</strong>, is a beneficiary of both the <strong>Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub</strong> and the <strong>AWS Activate</strong> startup programs. These strategic partnerships have provided $5,000 in Microsoft Azure credits, $1,000 in AWS infrastructure credits, and access to over $150,000 in enterprise-grade development and security tools accelerating innovation across our federal-focused initiatives.
					<br><br>
					<b>Introducing Andromeda</b><br><br>
					<strong>Andromeda</strong> is a cloud-agnostic cybersecurity and compliance automation platform developed by <strong>Bitfastt Inc.</strong>, the affiliate subsidiary of LNB Federal Corporation. Purpose-built for U.S. federal agencies and defense contractors, Andromeda simplifies the Risk Management Framework (RMF) by automating control validation, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring across FISMA, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, FedRAMP, DFARS, and CMMC 2.0.
					<br><br>
					Supporting Microsoft Azure Government, AWS GovCloud, and future IL4/IL5 on-prem workloads, Andromeda integrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Compliance as Code, and role-based access control to enforce Zero Trust architecture across the system lifecycle. It also interfaces with SIEM and SOAR platforms to provide real-time telemetry, anomaly detection, and automated enforcement of security policies.
					<br><br>
					With modular APIs, FIPS 140-3 aligned encryption, and Kubernetes-driven orchestration, Andromeda supports SCAP validation for STIG compliance and enables GitOps-based deployments across development, test, and production environments.
					<br><br>
					Backed by Microsoft and Amazon, Andromeda is currently under consideration for submission to the <strong>NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</strong> program and the <strong>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</strong> innovation pipeline.
